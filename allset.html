  <h1>Snoozing is enabled for your Gmail account!</h1>

  <p>
  Last snooze-shift: <?= shsh1() ?>.
  Snooze tallies as of <?= shdt() ?> are as follows:
  </p>
  <pre><?= tally() ?></pre>
  <p>
    (SNZ is the number of days snoozed,
    THR is the number of threads that are snoozed for that many days, and
    TOT is the cumulative total threads, 
    namely the number of threads that will end up back in your 
    inbox in the given number of days.
    The first line gives the inbox size.)
  </p>

<!--
  <p>And similarly for auto-expiring threads...</p>
  <pre><?= tally('x') ?></pre>
-->

  <p>See <a href="http://messymatters.com/snooze">Messy Matters</a>
    for how this works.
    Or read on for a summary.
                
    (WARNING: If you happen to already use Gmail labels like "7" --
    labels that are bare integers -- then
    this app will change those labels on you.
    You should probably either uninstall this app or change your labels.)
  </p>
  
      
  <h2>Snooze</h2>
  <p>
    All the magic is in the Gmail labels, using the standard Gmail interface. 
    A thread with a single number as a label, say "7", will reappear in the 
    inbox in 7 days. 
    To snooze for 7 days (assuming you have keyboard shortcuts turned on in 
    your Gmail settings) type: v7&lt;enter&gt;.
    That moves the thread from the inbox to the label "7".
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every night at midnight, everything will shift: threads labeled <i>i</i> 
    will move to <i>i-1</i>, with new labels created as needed.
    And anything with label "1" will reappear in the inbox, with no more 
    integer label.
  </p>  

  <h2>Re-Ping</h2>
  <p>
    Re-Ping just refers to snoozing your own outgoing mail so it comes back to 
    you and reminds you to follow up &mdash; re-ping the person &mdash; if you haven't 
    gotten a response.
    See <a href="http://messymatters.com/snooze">Messy Matters</a> for the how and
    why.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    In short, you want your own sent mail to be easily snoozeable, which means 
    creating a filter so your sent mail initially stays in your inbox:
    <ol>
      <li>Create a filter (available from the "show search options" dropdown on
        the search box)</li>
      <li>Set the From to your own email address, or your username -- something
        that will match all the email addresses you send from</li>
      <li>On the next screen, check nothing but "Never send it to Spam"</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

<h2>Auto-Expire</h2>
<p>UPDATE: I got rid of the auto-expire feature! If anyone actually liked it then I'll put it back.
</p>
<!--
  <p>
    Auto-Expire is like the inverse of Snooze.
    A thread in your inbox with a label like "x90" will automatically archive
    itself in 90 days.
    To apply such a label 
    (again, assuming keyboard shortcuts are enabled in your Gmail settings),
    type lx90&lt;enter&gt;.
    That applies the label "x90".
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly to Snooze, the number after the x will decrement nightly, until
    the number disappears and the label is just "x" (indicating auto-expired),
    when it will disappear from the inbox.
  </p>
-->

<h2>Pro Tip</h2>
<p>
  If you end up with many dozens of different snooze labels,
  the nightly shifting of labels may time out and some of your 
  snoozed threads could end up late.
  To prevent that, try to snooze things to labels that already exist so the
  labels don't proliferate too much.
</p>

<h2>Crude Intra-Day Snoozing</h2>
<p>
Threads with label 0 are ignored by the midnight label shift but every
day at noon, everything with label 0 is moved to the inbox.
So snoozing to label 0 is a way to snooze for less than a day if it's before
noon -- the thread comes back the same day at noon.
And if it's after noon, snoozing to label 0 makes the thread come back at noon
the following day.
That might be handy if it's almost midnight and you want the thread to come at noon
tomorrow instead of midnight tonight.
</p>
<p>
In short: snooze for less than a day with v0&lt;enter&gt; if it's before noon 
(comes back at noon) or v1&lt;enter&gt; if it's between noon and midnight 
(comes back at midnight).
</p>
<p>
You can also just use label 0 as a temporary holding area when organizing your inbox.
</p>

  <h1>Bonus Feature</h1>
  <p>
    <b>SMS Alerts:</b> Set up a Gmail filter for important email to have the 
    label "OMG" applied. 
    Whenever a message gets the OMG label, this app will text it to you as a 
    calendar reminder within a minute or so, and then remove the "OMG" label.
  </p>
